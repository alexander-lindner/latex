Unfortunately, using windows makes it even worse.","So, the big docker fan I was at the time, I created a docker image with a full installed texlive copy and shared it later through Docker Hub and Github. This image did a good job as I also could use it at my company in the Gitlab CI or at my private CI to automatically push a build document to my NextCloud. I therefore created some bash scripts to simplify the installation.","When I had done a university seminar with a friend of mine some draw backs popped out:","the size of the image","missing watch command","creating a project and utilising the docker image was a little mess because the entrypoint had to be overridden most of the time","So I decided to rework my image, however I wasn't motivated enough to really to it. When I started my master thesis, I was finally motivated and because I wanted to try out GO, I switched from by bash scripts to a go cli.","These changes were a lot of fun, so I decided to add more and more features, and now I spend some time from week to week and improve this project even further so everyone can use it with ease."]}],[{"l":"Home","p":["TeXtool is a small and powerful cli tool to create and manage latex projects. It utilises docker and latexmk. It supports all common latex features and tools like minted. TeXtools uses a docker image as a foundation and lets you customise the whole build, e.g. you can add additional, non latex tools."]}],[{"l":"Installation","p":["You need docker installed and permission to use docker.","TeXtool is provided through Github's Release feature. So, simply download the executable and put in the PATH."]},{"l":"Uninstallation"}],[{"l":"Create a sample project and compile it","p":["Install textool:","Create your first project, this is an interactive command.","This creates a directory demo-latex and a couple of files:","Stores options of the textool executable. For example, the final pdf file name is stored inside this file.","Your entrypoint to modify the used image. If you have chosen the :base image, you can install latex packages or even install completly other tools.

TeXtool will download the docker image if not already presented and build a project specific image using the Dockerfile. This image is later-on used to compile the project.","For example, the final image looks like below and is used to reduce compiling time because that image is only rebuild if the base image changed or you modified the Dockerfile.","You find the final PDF file next to the main.tex, in out example it's called demo.pdf:","Use the clean command to remove all build files.","Use the watch command to recompile the project after any changes to the project(so .tex files as well as images etc).","Use [CTRL] + [C] to stop watching.","Finally, use the bib command to quickly add an url as bibliography:"]}],[{"l":"Usage","p":["textool provides a help page using textool -h, which is a good starting point.","However, this part of the documentation will in detail introduce every command."]},{"l":"Options","p":["Use the -p parameter to provide a path to your base directory of your project.
