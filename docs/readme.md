TeXtool is a small and powerful cli tool to create and manage latex projects.
It utilises docker and latexmk.
It supports all common latex features and tools like *minted*.
TeXtools uses a [docker image](docker.md) as a foundation and lets you customise the whole build,
e.g. you can add additional, non latex tools.
