Unfortunately, using windows makes it even worse.","So, the big docker fan I was at the time, I created a docker image with a full installed texlive copy and shared it later through Docker Hub and Github. This image did a good job as I also could use it at my company in the Gitlab CI or at my private CI to automatically push a build document to my NextCloud. I therefore created some bash scripts to simplify the installation.","When I had done a university seminar with a friend of mine some draw backs popped out:","the size of the image","missing watch command","creating a project and utilising the docker image was a little mess because the entrypoint had to be overridden most of the time","So I decided to rework my image, however I wasn't motivated enough to really to it. When I started my master thesis, I was finally motivated and because I wanted to try out GO, I switched from by bash scripts to a go cli.","These changes were a lot of fun, so I decided to add more and more features, and now I spend some time from week to week and improve this project even further so everyone can use it with ease."]}],[{"l":"Home","p":["TeXtool is a small and powerful cli tool to create and manage latex projects.
